# Built With
- React JS and CSS for Design
- Used OpenWeatherMap API (for weather information) & OpenStreetMap API (for geographic location)

# Installation
1. Clone the repo and open your preferred coding editor 
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Begin viewing with local host link!

# Usage
This project can be used to find current data from cities of your choice. Besides just showing the temperature, this website will display the "what feels like" temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, a map is located for every city searched to show the exact location and temperature setting in the area. 
Working through this app has shown me how to progress with using React JS and design the frontend of the website through CSS, collaborating with using API keys and finding API's that can be used within the project.
